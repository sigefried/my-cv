\section{Objective}
\cvline{}{Seeking a full-time job opportunity as an Software Engineer.}

\section{Work Experience}
\cventry{April 2016--Present}{Linux system R\&D Engineer}{Sony}{Tokyo
Japan}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Works mainly as a team member at Base System R\&D Department, Linux kernel
      R\&D Section (team comprises around six people).
    \item Also, holds a team member position at the AI/Robotics Business Unit, System
      Software Development Section (team comprises around 20 people).
    \item Parallel work on two main projects:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Design and develop a secure application framework of embedded Linux
          for next generation IoT devices and robotics.
        \item Linux kernel/driver development for both current
          and next generation embedded system platforms.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\section{Educational Qualification}
\cventry{October 2013--March 2016}{M.S.}{The University of Tokyo}{Tokyo
Japan}{}{Graduate {S}chool of Information Science of Technology, Major in information and communication engineering}
\cventry{September 2009--July 2013}{B.Eng.}{Dong Hua University}{Shanghai China}{}{Department of Electrical Engineering, Major in electrical engineering and automation}  % arguments 3 to 6 can be left empty

\section{Selected Projects}

\cventry{}{Linux Kernel and System Security Software Development for next generation platform.}{Linux kernel and system security software development.}{C/C++,Python,Golang}{}{\textbf{Techniques:}  Embedded system development, Linux kernel development, Containerization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--]{Responsible for Linux kernel and driver development for next
    generation platforms. Reduced the kernel crash rate around 30\% and reduced the kernel boot time around 40\%.}
  \item[--]{Designed and implemented containerization software for embedded Linux
    platforms which have only limited resources.}
  \item[--]{Coordinated container software work with other system middleware.}
\end{itemize}

\cventry{April 2014--March 2016}{A highly accurate pedestrian navigation system for urban canyon environment}{Height Aided PNS}{C/C++,Python,Java}{}{\textbf{Techniques:} Optimization, Self
Localization, GNSS, Wi-Fi Localization, Android Programming}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--]{Designed, implemented and evaluated a height aided GNSS algorithm for
    pedestrian in the urban environment under the supervision of a senior researcher
  and professor. This method improves the mean error of GNSS localization from 17 meters to 12 meters in urban canyon.}
  \item[--]{Integrated the height aided GNSS with PDR and Wi-Fi localization system. The integrated pedestrian navigation system could achieve around 6.5 meters mean error in urban canyon.}
  \item[--]{This project was my master's thesis. The output of this project was sold to a well-known company.}
\end{itemize}

\cventry{August 2012--May 2013}{A stochastic local search algorithm based SAT
solver}{vflipnum}{C/C++}{}{\textbf{Techniques:}
Satisfiability.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--]{Invented a new stochastic local search algorithm for solving SAT problem under the supervision of the professor.}
  \item[--]{This solver was submitted to SAT competition 2013 and ranked in 10th out of 25 solvers in the sequential, random SAT group.}
  \item[--]{This project was my undergraduate thesis, which won \em{Excellent
Bachelor's Thesis Award} in July 2013.}
\end{itemize}

\cventry{February 2012-- July 2012}{A cow health assessment system using Kinect.}{Cow
Evaluator}{C/C++}{}{\textbf{Techniques:} OpenCV, Kinect}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--]{Designed, implemented and evaluated an algorithm to calculate the health
    score of the cows which could be used to classify them into five groups. The
  scores are calculated using images with depth data token by Kinect. The
classification accuracy rate was around 75\%, which is a satisfiable number for
cow farmers.}
  \item[--]{This project won \em{3rd place at the Intel Cup Embedded System
Design Contest} in July 2012.}
\end{itemize}
